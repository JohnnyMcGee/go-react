# Go - World's Oldest Strategy Game
## Overview
go-react is a web app adaptation of Go - a strategic game similar to chess, but much older.
The game board and pieces are react components enabling fast, responsive, in-browser gameplay.

For those interested, a demo version is hosted here:

NOTE: go-react is only a front end UI. It depends on a backend service to provide the game engine.
See [go-api](https://github.com/JohnnyMcGee/go-api), a REST api game engine written in the Go language.

### Under Construction!
In its current form, the app is just a game board. Anyone can view and play moves on the board.
Features currently under development include:
* Link sharing - Invite a friend to play by sending a link to a specific game session
* AI Opponent - Players can pit themselves against a [neural net player](https://katagotraining.org/)
